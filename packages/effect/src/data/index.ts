/**
 * This module provides types and utility functions to create and work with
 * branded types, which are TypeScript types with an added type tag to prevent
 * accidental usage of a value in the wrong context.
 *
 * The `refined` and `nominal` functions are both used to create branded types
 * in TypeScript. The main difference between them is that `refined` allows for
 * validation of the data, while `nominal` does not.
 *
 * The `nominal` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same
 * underlying type as the input, but with a different name. This is useful when
 * you want to distinguish between two values of the same type that have
 * different meanings. The `nominal` function does not perform any validation of
 * the input data.
 *
 * On the other hand, the `refined` function is used to create a new branded
 * type that has the same underlying type as the input, but with a different
 * name, and it also allows for validation of the input data. The `refined`
 * function takes a predicate that is used to validate the input data. If the
 * input data fails the validation, a `BrandErrors` is returned, which provides
 * information about the specific validation failure.

/**
 * This module provides utilities for creating data types with structural equality
 * semantics. Unlike regular JavaScript objects, `Data` types support value-based
 * equality comparison using the `Equal` module.
 *
 * The main benefits of using `Data` types are:
 * - **Structural equality**: Two `Data` objects are equal if their contents are equal
 * - **Immutability**: `Data` types are designed to be immutable
 * - **Type safety**: Constructors ensure type safety and consistency
 * - **Effect integration**: Error types work seamlessly with Effect's error handling

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with equivalence relations - binary relations that are
 * reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Equivalence relations define when two values of the same type
 * should be considered equivalent, which is fundamental for comparing, deduplicating, and organizing data.
 *
 * An equivalence relation must satisfy three properties:
 * - **Reflexive**: Every value is equivalent to itself
 * - **Symmetric**: If `a` is equivalent to `b`, then `b` is equivalent to `a`
 * - **Transitive**: If `a` is equivalent to `b` and `b` is equivalent to `c`, then `a` is equivalent to `c`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Equivalence } from "effect/data"
 * import { Array } from "effect/collections"
 *
 * // Case-insensitive string equivalence
 * const caseInsensitive = Equivalence.make<string>((a, b) =>
 *   a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()
 * )
 *
 * // Use with array deduplication
 * const strings = ["Hello", "world", "HELLO", "World"]
 * const deduplicated = Array.dedupeWith(strings, caseInsensitive)
 * console.log(deduplicated) // ["Hello", "world"]
 *
 * // Product type equivalence
 * interface Person {
 *   name: string
 *   age: number
 * }
 *
 * const personEquivalence = Equivalence.struct({
 *   name: caseInsensitive,
 *   age: Equivalence.strict<number>()
 * })

/**
 * This module provides an implementation of the `Order` type class which is used to define a total ordering on some type `A`.
 * An order is defined by a relation `<=`, which obeys the following laws:
 *
 * - either `x <= y` or `y <= x` (totality)
 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= x`, then `x == y` (antisymmetry)
 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= z`, then `x <= z` (transitivity)
 *
 * The truth table for compare is defined as follows:
 *
 * | `x <= y` | `x >= y` | Ordering |                       |
 * | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------- |
 * | `true`   | `true`   | `0`      | corresponds to x == y |
 * | `true`   | `false`  | `< 0`    | corresponds to x < y  |
 * | `false`  | `true`   | `> 0`    | corresponds to x > y  |

/**
 * @fileoverview
 * The Ordering module provides utilities for working with comparison results and ordering operations.
 * An Ordering represents the result of comparing two values, expressing whether the first value is
 * less than (-1), equal to (0), or greater than (1) the second value.
 *
 * This module is fundamental for building comparison functions, sorting algorithms, and implementing
 * ordered data structures. It provides composable operations for combining multiple comparison results
 * and pattern matching on ordering outcomes.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Type-safe representation of comparison results (-1, 0, 1)
 * - Composable operations for combining multiple orderings
 * - Pattern matching utilities for handling different ordering cases
 * - Ordering reversal and combination functions
 * - Integration with Effect's functional programming patterns
 *
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - Implementing custom comparison functions
 * - Building complex sorting criteria
 * - Combining multiple comparison results
 * - Creating ordered data structures
 * - Pattern matching on comparison outcomes
